# MonitorSleeper
A Windows PowerShell script that repeatedly sleeps (Standby Power) your monitors every 7 seconds.

Some monitors have issues with DisplayPort Deep Sleep. (My Asus XG27AQM specifically being unable to turn this off via any menu).

If your monitor has the issue where Deep Sleep causes your DP link to restablish and force a handshake which wakes it you can use this tool.

How to use?

Simply run the script and it will run indefinetly, press F10 anywhere to terminate it.
